# Grok Scripts - *Scripts for Various Fact Extractors*

This repository contains Grok scripts that highlight the power of relational algebra as a static analysis tool. They are built for the following fact extractors: [bfx64](https://github.com/bmuscede/bfx64), [ClangEx](https://github.com/bmuscede/ClangEx), and [Rex](https://github.com/bmuscede/Rex). To use these scripts, models of source code have to be generated using the appropriate fact extractor.

## What Is a Grok Script?
A Grok script is a script file designed for the [Grok relational algebra engine](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~holt/papers/grok-intro.html). This engine works with models encoded in a plain text format called tuple-attribute (similar to the Rigi Standard Format).

By using fact extractors on source code, these extractors will generate a program model in the tuple-attribute format that can then be queried by the Grok relational engine.

The scripts in this repository are tailored for models generated by the bfx64, ClangEx, and Rex extractors. These scripts do a variety of different types of static analysis.

## Organization of this Repository
This repository is split into three different folders. Each folder contains scripts specific to one fact extractor. As such, the folders are as follows:
1) ClangExScripts - *Scripts for the ClangEx extractor.*
2) ROSScripts - *Scripts for the Rex extractor.*
3) bfx64Scripts - *Scripts for the bfx64 extractor.*

Each repository has a readme that describes the variety of scripts one might encounter.
